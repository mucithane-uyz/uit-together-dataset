## Category Selection
Vietnam’s ethnic minority costumes gradually receive more attention through images which performed by KOLs or in music videos.The need of searching national costumes is increasing day by day. However, it is quite difficult to collect data on images of ethnic minority costumes on the internet. Therefore, we built a dataset about Vietnamese Ethnic Minority Costumes Classification (UIT-VEMC21), consisting of these 10 most largest ethnic groups: Tay, Thai, Muong, H’Mong, Dao, Ede, Ba Na, Cham, San Diu, Ra Glai.
