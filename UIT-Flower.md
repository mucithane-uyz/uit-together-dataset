We collected data from 21 common flower species. Our primary source of income comes from Google Image, Instagram, Pinterest, Bing, Baidu combined with self-collected images in daily life. We expanded our search on the Internet by using keywords or searching in different languages during our search on the Internet. The images are stored in 21 different folders corresponding to 21 flower species. However, due to collecting many images simultaneously, there are many duplicate images, gifs, and images of poor quality and do not contain objects of interest. In such cases, we will remove them.
In order to ensure that there is no confusion between classes as well as the existence of images that do not serve the problem. We conducted a phase to check the dataset labels, which is divided into two sub-stage. First, each member participating in data collection will self-check their data. Next, we cross-checked each other. In the case of error detection, we will discuss it together.

Illustration 21 flowers on the UIT-Flower dataset

UIT-Flower dataset includes 81,909 images for 21 flowers, which promises many challenges in building classification models in 4 perspectives. 
1. **The flowers have a variety of colors.** We do not limit fixed colors for one flower so that a flower can have different colors depending on the natural conditions in each other region.
2. **The flowers have the same color.** Because we didn't limit the color of flowers, the different flowers also encounter the same color. 
3. **The flowers have a variety of shapes.** At each period of growth, flowers will have different shapes or are affected by weather conditions or care. The flowers also have mutant shapes, but the basic characteristics remain the same.
4. **Image contains noise factor.** Flowers are often used for decoration or gifts, so images containing flowers often have other objects attached. For example, flowers are placed in vases or bunched together with other decorative items. However, we only keep the images when the images focus on the flower.
